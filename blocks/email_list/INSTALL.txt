IMPORTANT: This version is NOT a module for Moodle.
This conception has changed. It has happened to be a
module to be an integral system of internal mail.

If you're installed Email module, before you uninstall it, after you can
install eMail integration.

Only install on versions >= 1.7.

BBDD suported has MySQL and PostgreSQL


Here is a basic outline of the installation process,
which normally takes me only a few seconds:

1) Copy "email_list" folder into moodle blocks folder, "moodle/blocks/"

2) Login by Admin, and click on Notifications link (Administration Block) or reload for install. In this moment
if the bbdd structure not created, it has been created.

For bugs, please contact with Toni Mas (toni.mas@uib.es), thanks.
